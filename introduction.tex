\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Reservoir computing (RC) is a novel approach to machine learning and intelligent systems, in which input data is imposed as perturbations on a dynamic system (the reservoir) and output is generated by performing a linear readout of the reservoir state.
In RC systems where the reservoir output is spiking in nature, such as cellular automata and biological neurons, spiketrains from the reservoir is typically converted to analog values before being processed by a linear readout layer.
To avoid expensive floating point operations and possible introduction of unwanted bias to the system, it is desireable to avoid this conversion and allow data to remain in its spiking form for as long as possible.

In this paper we propose a simplified spiking neural network model (SSNN) suitable for use as a readout-layer in an RC system.
Through experiments simulated in software, we show that the model is capable of classifying reservoir dynamics based on raw spiketrain data.
We also show that the model maps efficiently to hardware, and provide an overview of possible further work.

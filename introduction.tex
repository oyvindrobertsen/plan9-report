\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Reservoir computing (RC) is a novel approach to machine learning and intelligent systems, in which input data is imposed as perturbations on a dynamic system (the reservoir) and output is generated by performing a linear readout of the reservoir state.
With its origins in research on various types of recurrent neural networks and training thereof, the reservoir in RC systems is often represented as an RNN.~\cite{Verstraeten2007}
However, any dynamic system capable of eventually forgetting past perturbations and of responding distinctly to different perturbations, can in principle be used.
Snyder et al.~\cite{Snyder2013} investigate using Random Boolean Networks, Yilmaz uses Cellular Automata and Fernando et al.\ use a bucket of water~\cite{Fernando2003}.

In RC systems where the reservoir output is spiking in nature, such as cellular automata and liquid state machines, spiketrains from the reservoir is typically converted to analog values before being processed by a linear readout layer.
In this paper we propose a simplified spiking neural network model (SSNN) suitable for use as a readout-layer in an RC system.
Through experiments simulated in software, we show that the model is capable of classifying reservoir dynamics based on raw spiketrain data.
We also show that the model maps efficiently to hardware, and provide an overview of possible further work.

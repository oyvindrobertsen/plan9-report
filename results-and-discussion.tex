\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results-and-discussion}
% \subsection{Description}
% This section presents the results of your experiments,
% comparing your solution to other schemes. The metrics of
% interest are highly dependent on the topic of research, but
% should optimally cover all interesting aspects of your scheme.
% Informative graphs or tables are the key to a good result
% section.
% Furthermore, you need to discuss your results. You should
% give explanations of distinctive points and outliers in your
% results. It is also necessary to state why your scheme is
% better/worse compared to the other schemes. Thus, this section
% consists of two parts: the results of your experiments, as well
% as an explanation as to why the results are as they are

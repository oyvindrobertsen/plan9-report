% \subsection{Description}
% The methodology section explains your experimental setup.
% It should state every bit of information that is necessary in
% order to be able to reproduce your results. It further covers
% your actions taken in order to ensure that you are really
% measuring what you think you are measuring as well as your
% actions that were taken in order to validate your results. The
% goals are to set up realistic experiments and be absolutely
% convinced that you took care of all side-effects as well as to
% state enough information such that your experiments are fully
% reproducible.

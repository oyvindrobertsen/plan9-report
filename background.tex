\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
%The background section covers knowledge that is necessary
%for understanding the proposed solution, but you cannot expect
%the audience of the paper to be familiar with. This is commonly
%the case when you propose solutions that incorporate
%knowledge from different research areas. An example would
%be an implementation of a compression scheme between
%memory and processor in order to decrease memory bandwidth
%utilization. It is very likely that you would need to explain
%the compression scheme, since most computer architecture
%researchers would not be familiar with it.
